The python version reference vector guided evolutionary algorithm.

Currently supported: Multi-objective minimization with visualization and interaction support. Preference is accepted as a reference point.

To test the code, open the [binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/EchoBetaGlass/pyrvea/master) and read example.ipynb.

Read the documentation [here](https://pyrvea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

### Requirements:
* Python 3.6 or up
* [Poetry dependency manager](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry)

### Installation process:
* Download and extract the code
* Create a new virtual environment for the project
* Run `poetry install --no-dev` in the activated virtual environment to install the packages necessary to run the code.
* If you want to take part in the development process, run `poetry install` instead.
