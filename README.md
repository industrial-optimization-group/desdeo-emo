[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/industrial-optimization-group/desdeo-emo/master)

The evolutionary algorithms package within the [DESDEO framework](https://github.com/industrial-optimization-group/DESDEO).

Code for the SoftwareX paper can be found in [this notebook](docs/notebooks/Using_EvoNN_for_optimization.ipynb).

Currently supported:
* Multi-objective optimization with visualization and interaction support.
* Preference is accepted as a reference point.
* Surrogate modelling (neural networks and genetic trees) evolved via EAs.
* Surrogate assisted optimization
* Constraint handling using `RVEA`
* IOPIS optimization using `RVEA` and `NSGA-III`

Currently _NOT_ supported:
* Binary and integer variables.

To test the code, open the [binder link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/industrial-optimization-group/desdeo-emo/master) and read example.ipynb.
